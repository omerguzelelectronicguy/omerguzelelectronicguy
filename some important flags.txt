--no-addresses
           When disassembling, don't print addresses on each line or for
           symbols and relocation offsets.  In combination with
           --no-show-raw-insn this may be useful for comparing compiler
           output.


           
--no-show-raw-insn
           When disassembling instructions, do not print the instruction
           bytes.  This is the default when --prefix-addresses is used.

 --insn-width=width
           Display width bytes on a single line when disassembling
           instructions.

       --visualize-jumps[=color|=extended-color|=off]
           Visualize jumps that stay inside a function by drawing ASCII
           art between the start and target addresses.  The optional
           =color argument adds color to the output using simple
           terminal colors.  Alternatively the =extended-color argument
           will add color using 8bit colors, but these might not work on
           all terminals.

           If it is necessary to disable the visualize-jumps option
           after it has previously been enabled then use
           visualize-jumps=off.



--source-comment[=txt]
           Like the -S option, but all source code lines are displayed
           with a prefix of txt.  Typically txt will be a comment string
           which can be used to distinguish the assembler code from the
           source code.  If txt is not provided then a default string of
           "# " (hash followed by a space), will be used.



--save-temps
    This create temporary files after preprocessed compiled linked and assembled.
